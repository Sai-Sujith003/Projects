# Projects

I did some small projects on Computer Vision (with some help of online resources) which you can find here, check them out!!

You can find the pima-indians-diabetes.csv file in this repo, which I downloaded from the Internet and used it to predict whether a given person having diabetes or not using DeepLearning library Keras in python.

I'm new to GitHub, so let me know if I did any mistakes, so that I can learn to correct those mistakes.
